# 📉 Customer Churn Analysis in Power BI

This project analyzes customer churn data from a fictional telecom company, **Databel**, using **Power BI**. It was developed as part of a real-world case study offered by **DataCamp** and covers everything from data modeling to dashboard design.

## 🎯 Objective

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Power BI Desktop
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)
- Power Query
- DataCamp Learning Platform
